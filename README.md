# Sample Java Modules

This repository contains working Java code samples


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

## Running the Samples
 1.  Clone this repository.
 2.  cd path/to/src  
 3.  Then compile and run a sample directly by name:    
```
     > javac oop1/[SampleName].java
     > java oop1.[SampleName]
```
e.g.
```
     > javac oop1/StudentScanner.java
     > java oop1.StudentScanner
```
Running SampleCode without compiling does'nt work.
